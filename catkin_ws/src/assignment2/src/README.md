1. Circle.py: Make the Turtle move in a circle with constant twist velocity

The The turtle is made to simulate in circle using constant twist velocity using circle.py  file and launching by c.launch file. For reference check videos folder.

2. Square_openloop.py: Make the Turtle move in a square of 2x2 units with 0.2 linear
   velocity and 0.2 rad/s angular velocity. Use this Move in a Straight Line tutorial as a
   reference

The The turtle is made to simulate in square of 2x2 units with 0.2 linear
velocity and 0.2 rad/s angular velocity using open.py file and launching by open.launch file. For reference check videos folder.

3. Square_closedloop.py: Make the Turtle move in a square of 3x3 with velocity control.
   Predefine the coordinate points of the square in the program. Make the turtle move from
   (5,5) ->(8,5) -> (8,8) -> (5,8) -> (5,5)
   
The The turtle is made to simulate move from (5,5) ->(8,5) -> (8,8) -> (5,8) -> (5,5) in square of 3x3 with velocity control with predefine the coordinate points of the square in the program using closed.py file and launching by closed.launch file. For reference check videos folder.
